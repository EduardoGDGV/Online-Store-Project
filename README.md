## Comments About the Code
- The code is organized into separate modules for user management, product management, and order processing.
- Inline comments have been added to complex functions for clarity.
- Follow the naming conventions for variables and functions to enhance readability.

## Test Plan
We will conduct the following tests to ensure functionality:
- **Unit Tests:** Each function will be tested individually to verify correctness.
- **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between modules (e.g., user login and product browsing).
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Gather feedback from users to ensure the app meets their needs.

**Testing Tools:** We plan to use [JUnit](https://junit.org/) for unit tests and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the backend API.
